test-3
another one


hello, this is my contribution.

Case: (one PR containing three commits, where first 2 had deletions, but third one had same readme as og fork so no net deletions) => now this should only contain additions as net effect of all 3 commits (it did work)

Case: Interleaved merge commit, wonky branch history
